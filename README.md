# Multiclass Neural Network for Classifying Handwritten Digits in MNIST Dataset using Azure ML Studio
This project demonstrates how to use Azure Machine Learning Studio to train and deploy a multiclass neural network for classifying handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset.

The MNIST dataset is a collection of 70,000 handwritten digits (0 to 9), with 60,000 images used for training and 10,000 images used for testing. The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately classify these images into their respective digit classes.

# Prerequisites
An Azure subscription
Access to Azure Machine Learning Studio
Basic knowledge of machine learning and neural networks
# Getting Started
Launch Azure Machine Learning Studio and create a new experiment
Import the MNIST dataset into the experiment
Dataset has already resizing them to 28x28 pixels 
Split the data into training and testing sets
Build a multiclass neural network using the "Multiclass Neural Network" module in Azure ML Studio
Train the model using the training data
Evaluate the performance of the model using the testing data

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to use Azure Machine Learning Studio to build and deploy a multiclass neural network for classifying handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset. The model achieved high accuracy in classifying the digits, demonstrating the power of neural networks in image classification tasks.
